# SeedBot: a self-evolving personal assistant

A bootstrapper that turns [Codex](https://openai.com/codex/) into a personal assistant.

SeedBot starts with only two abilities: **coding** and **terminal input**. From there, it can build new capabilities upon requests.

Inspired by [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) and [nanobot](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot).

> Built with **< 100 lines of Bash**.

## TODO

- [x] Cross compare with nanobot.
- [x] Add timeout to prevent blocking calls.
- [x] Support non-blocking launch of codex while still stick with <100 lines of code.

## Prerequisites

- Preconfigured Codex CLI (GPT-5.3-Codex recommended)
- macOS, Linux, or WSL with Bash

## Quick Start

On macOS, install GNU coreutils and alias `timeout` to `gtimeout`. Also need to upgrade Bash since MacOS comes with an outdated Bash.

```bash
brew install coreutils
brew install bash
alias timeout=gtimeout
```

Run SeedBot (add `-v` if you want to view codex execution details):

```bash
./main.sh
```

Checkpoint your trained assistant for distribution:

```bash
echo "pack the current non-git-tracked files, with corresponding git commit, into my_assistant.tar for distribution. Remember to mask out the sensitive variables and keep non-sensitive variables in env.sh and don't pack files under logs" | codex exec --full-auto --skip-git-repo-check -
```

## Why Codex

Codex is preferred over Claude Code for SeedBot because:

- Codex handles complex logic and ambiguous requests more reliably.
- OpenAI has more permissive legal terms for backend-in-app workflows, especially for subscriptions.

## Notes

SeedBot is a proof of concept: coding is the only truly essential primitive for a capable personal assistant.

For production-grade setups, prefer [Codex App Server](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app-server/) over shell-piped invocation.
